### `Key Files`

To perform reliable timing verification of the BabySoC design after routing, we use OpenSTA with a dedicated TCL script, a post-CTS constraints file, and the post-route SPEF file.

The `sta_across_pvt_route.tcl` script automates static timing analysis across multiple process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners, while the `vsdbabysoc_post_cts.sdc` file provides the design-specific timing constraints generated after clock tree synthesis, and the `vsdbabysoc.spef` file supplies the post-route parasitic RC data. Together, these files ensure that STA is run under the correct operating conditions with accurate parasitic delays, and that reports such as setup/hold slack, WNS, and TNS are captured for each library corner.

This `vsdbabysoc_post_cts.sdc` file is an auto-generated SDC created after clock tree synthesis. It sets the current design to `vsdbabysoc` and defines the basic timing environment. The file specifies a clock named `clk` with an `11 ns` period, driven from the pin `pll/CLK`, and marks it as a propagated clock for STA. Sections for environment and design rules are also included for adding further constraints if needed.

### `Running STA`

To run the post-route STA using Docker, follow these steps to execute the `sta_across_pvt_route.tcl` script. Launch a Docker container with your local directory mounted, run the script inside the container, and it will generate all timing reports such as setup/hold slack, WNS, and TNS in the mounted `/data` folder. Using Docker ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for performing the analysis.

```shell
docker run -it -v $HOME:/data opensta /data/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/OpenSTA/examples/BabySoC/sta_across_pvt_route.tcl
```

After running the STA script, you can navigate to the `STA_OUTPUT/route/` directory to see all the generated timing reports. This includes detailed path delay reports for each library corner (`min_max_*.txt`), worst setup and hold slack summaries (`sta_worst_max_slack.txt and sta_worst_min_slack.txt`), as well as total negative slack (sta_tns.txt) and worst negative slack (`sta_wns.txt`). These files provide a complete overview of the BabySoC design’s timing performance after routing.

### `Key Differences: Post-Synthesis vs Post-Route Timing Analysis`

| Aspect             | Post-Synthesis Analysis                            | Post-Route Analysis                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing Model**   | Wire-load models (fanout/cell-based estimation)    | Extracted parasitics (RC) from routed layout                  |
| **Clock Network**  | Ideal clock, zero skew, no latency                 | Real clock tree with buffer delays, skew, and insertion delay |
| **Interconnect**   | Delay estimated from fanout-based lookup tables    | Delay calculated from actual metal routing and vias           |
| **Accuracy**       | \~70–80% correlation with sign-off                 | \~95–98% correlation with sign-off                            |
| **Critical Paths** | Critical paths may differ due to estimation errors | Matches actual layout critical paths                          |

### `Summary`
- Post-synthesis analysis serves as an **early timing checkpoint**.  
- Post-route analysis represents the **golden reference for timing sign-off**.  
- Transition from estimated to actual physical parameters often reveals:
  - New critical paths revealed
  - Realistic clock tree effects (skew, latency)
  - Interconnect-dominated delays
  - Impact of physical proximity & coupling

#### Why Post-Route Timing Differs from Pre-Route Timing

- **Estimated vs Actual Delays**: Pre-route timing (post-synthesis) uses wire-load and fanout-based models to estimate delays, while post-route timing uses accurate parasitic data extracted from the final routed layout.  
- **Clock Network Realism**: Pre-route assumes ideal clock with no skew or latency; post-route includes real clock tree delays, buffer insertion, and skew effects from routing.  
- **Interconnect Details**: Actual wire lengths, resistances, and capacitances are known post-route, unlike approximations pre-route, causing real interconnect delays to be accounted for.  
- **Critical Path Changes**: Post-route analysis can reveal new critical paths or worsen existing paths due to routing effects and proximity.  
- **Accuracy Levels**: Post-route STA achieves higher correlation (~95-98%) to silicon timing than pre-route (~70-80%) due to real physical data integration.

#### How SPEF Annotation Affects Path Delays

- **Parasitic Extraction**: SPEF files provide detailed resistance and capacitance (RC) parasitic values for wires and vias after routing.  
- **Accurate Delay Modeling**: Annotating SPEF parasitics to the timing graph allows STA tools to compute realistic delays rather than estimates.  
- **Coupling Capacitance**: SPEF includes coupling capacitances between adjacent nets, which contribute to crosstalk delay effects in timing calculations.  
- **Delay Impact on Paths**: Added parasitics from SPEF increase propagation delays on nets, often making paths slower and affecting slack values significantly.

#### Impact of Physical Effects on Timing Closure

- **Capacitance Effects**: Increased parasitic capacitance slows down signal transitions, raising path delays and risking setup violations.  
- **Resistance Effects**: Wire and via resistance cause RC delay buildup, lengthening signal travel time along paths.  
- **Coupling Effects**: Crosstalk from coupled capacitances introduces noise and additional delay uncertainty, potentially causing hold violations.  
- **Physical Proximity & Layout**: Closely routed nets experience stronger coupling; longer routes introduce higher parasitics, stressing timing margins.  
- **Timing Closure Challenges**: These physical effects exposed post-routing often require design adjustments such as buffer insertion, re-routing, or logic optimization to meet timing.

This detailed understanding explains why post-route STA is the gold standard for timing sign-off, revealing hidden issues and guiding final design closure effectively.
